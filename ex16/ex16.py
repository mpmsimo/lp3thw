"""
First we need to create a new directory for the exercise.
mkdir ex16

Let's move the script to the newly created directory.
mv ex16.py ex16

Afterwards we can create a new file.
touch ex16/ex16.txt

Let's add some text, and then append another line.
echo "Hello world" > ex16/ex16.txt && echo "This is another line" >> ex16/ex16.txt

Just to be sure, let's check to see if the text was actually written to file.
cat ex16/ex16.txt

Looks good! Now let's run the script against the newly created file.
